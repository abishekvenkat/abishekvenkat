### hey there, i'm abishek 👋

*i build stuff mostly because i'm lazy* – if i have to do something twice, might as well automate it, right?

📍 currently based in bengaluru, india

---

### what i'm up to

🌱 learning react and python (one component at a time)
💡 thinking about ways to make boring tasks less boring
🏗️ building random projects when inspiration strikes

### some things about me

⚡ i really love mangoes, football, and monospace fonts
🎯 i'm all about that work smarter, not harder life
☕ probably drinking coffee while writing this

---

### wanna see what i've built?

check out my [repos](https://github.com/abishekvenkat?tab=repositories) – there's probably something random in there 🕵️

*feel free to reach out if you wanna chat about code, football, or the best mango varieties*

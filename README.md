### hey there, i'm abishek 👋

*i build stuff mostly because i'm lazy* – if i have to do something twice, might as well automate it.

📍 currently based in bengaluru, india

### what i build

💡 utilities that solve small annoyances. file converters, bookmark managers, diff tools, calculators. if it saves me 30 seconds, it's worth a weekend.

🎮 i also make games:
 - [morseman](https://github.com/abishekvenkat/morseman) (hangman in morse code)
 - [terminal-snake](https://github.com/abishekvenkat/terminal-snake)
 - [pick-a-potty](https://github.com/abishekvenkat/pick-a-potty)
 - [bulls and cows](https://github.com/abishekvenkat/bulls-and-cows)

📜 i might be in a relationship with monospace fonts
🎯 i'm all about that work smarter, not harder life
☕ probably drinking coffee while writing this
